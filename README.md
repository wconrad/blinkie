# blinkie

If this project hatches, it will become a simulation of an old-school
computer with a blinking-light front panel.  Right now, it's just a
technology demonstrator showing a simulation of a small front panel
with LEDs, toggle switches, and momentary switches.  It implements a
binary counter with some controls.
